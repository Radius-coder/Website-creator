## What is is
This program uses python to create websites. The program will create and edit a HTML, CSS and javascript file.

## How it works
When you run the program you will be shown this menu:

Currently all features but 'Add a Timeline' are working.

When you select a feature the program will ask more questiosn to help the user personalise the feature.
Here is another screenshot of what this is like:

## Closer look at each feature
Here I will show you an example of what each feature can output and then I will include a screenshot of a website using all features. 
There will be one picture of what I inputted into python and then below will be a picutre of the resulting output.

### Add header,logo and title

The logo image will need to be sized manually to fit in the header. Here there is white space as it was orignally a white a background and MS Paint did not fill correctly.
### Add navigation bar

At any time the user has to input a colour then can either write it using the hex code, rgb value or just standard english. For example, inputs that are valid include: "red" or "#f1f1f1" or "rgb(255,255,255)"
### Add images
